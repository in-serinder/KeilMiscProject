# KeilMiscProject
Some exercises or finished products of Keil (` usually a single module or function `) are placed in a folder as separate projects. Each folder contains the project files, including ` .uvproj `, ` .uvopt `, ` .c ` and ` .h ` files, and a ` ReadMe.md ` for a brief introduction. To use them, please clone this repository.

```
git clone  https://github.com/in-serinder/KeilMiscProject.git
